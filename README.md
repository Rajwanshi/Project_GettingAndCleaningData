# Project_GettingAndCleaningData
Final Project

Steps to run run_analysis.R file :-
1. Download the above zip file and unzip it  
2. Save the run_analysis.R file in the same directory as the extracted folder from the zip file 
3. Make sure you have 3.3.0 or higher version of R installed on your computer 
4. You should have dplyr and plyr libraries installed into your computer  
5. Run the R files in the R terminal (cli), the output tiny.txt file will be created in the same directory containing the clean data




The R-code in run_analysis.R does the following:- 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
